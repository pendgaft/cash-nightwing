Ok, in principle, this is simple.  We get the amount of traffic that flows between two ASes, then
get who is the customer of who.  Afterthat we do some math.....

The amount of traffic gets multiplied by the cost, then there is actually some amount of guess work as to a scaling
  --Smaller ISPs charge more "per byte" than larger ISPs
  
It should be noted that the amount of traffic that transits the link is all that matters, not the direction.
